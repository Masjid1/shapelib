shapelib
===============================

Python utilities to facilitate working with shapely (shape creation, rasterization, plotting)

* Free software: BSD license
* Documentation: http://shapelib.rtfd.org.

Features
--------

* provides easy methods to interact with shapely and other related libraries
* easy creation of complex geometric shapes
* geometric operations:
  - extend line
  - extrapolate points
  - generate perpendicular lines
  - calculate angles
  - find the nearest points between two geometries
* rasterization
  - convert a shape to an array
  - convert a shape to a picture
  - plot a complex shape with matplotlib

Incentive
---------

shapelib started as a set of utilities to build geometric shapes as part of acoustic simulations (walls, ducts, tubes). It proved to be useful outside of this specific domain.
